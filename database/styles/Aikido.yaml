      Aikido (Shinjitai: 合気道, Kyūjitai: 合氣道,) is a modern
      Japanese martial art that is split into many different styles,
      including Iwama Ryu, Iwama Shin Shin Aiki Shuren Kai, Shodokan
      Aikido, Yoshinkan, Renshinkai, Aikikai and Ki Aikido. Aikido is
      now practiced in around 140 countries. It was originally
      developed by Morihei Ueshiba, as a synthesis of his martial
      studies, philosophy and religious beliefs. Ueshiba's goal was to
      create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves
      while also protecting their attackers from injury.
