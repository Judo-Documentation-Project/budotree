      Sambo (Russian: сaмбо, pronounced [ˈsambə]) is a martial art
      with Soviet origins, an internationally practised combat sport,
      and a recognized style of amateur wrestling included by UWW in
      the World Wrestling Championships along with Graeco-Roman
      wrestling and freestyle wrestling.  It originated in the Russian
      SFSR in the Soviet Union. The word sambo is an acronym of
      samozashchita bez oruzhiya (Russian: самозащита без оружия),
      which literally translates to 'self-defence without weapons'.
      SAMBO is a martial art and combat sport developed and used by
      the Soviet Red Army in the early 1920s to improve their
      hand-to-hand combat abilities. The sport is similar in many ways
      to judo and jiu jitsu but also incorporates different types of
      wrestling and various self-defence systems.  Soviet martial arts
      expert Vasili Oshchepkov is credited as one of the founding
      fathers of SAMBO.
