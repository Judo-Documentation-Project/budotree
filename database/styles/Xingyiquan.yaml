      Xingyiquan, or Xingyi, is a style of internal Chinese martial
      arts. The word translates approximately to "Form-Intention
      Fist", or "Shape-Will Fist". It is characterized by
      aggressive, seemingly linear movements and explosive power most
      often applied from a short range. A practitioner of Xingyi uses
      coordinated movements to generate bursts of power intended to
      overwhelm the opponent, simultaneously attacking and
      defending. Methods vary from school to school, but always
      include bare-handed fighting training (mostly in single
      movements/combinations and sometimes in forms) and the training
      of weapons usage with similar or identical body mechanics to
      that used for bare-handed intense fighting. The most basic
      notions of movement and body mechanics in the art were heavily
      influenced by the practice of staves and spears.
