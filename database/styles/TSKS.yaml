      Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū (天真正伝香取神道流) is one of
      the oldest extant Japanese martial arts, and an exemplar of
      bujutsu. The Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū was founded by
      Iizasa Ienao, born in 1387 in Iizasa village (modern Takomachi,
      Chiba Prefecture), who was living near Katori Shrine (Sawara
      City, Chiba Prefecture) at the time. The ryū gives 1447 as the
      year it was founded, but some scholars state that it was about
      1480.
