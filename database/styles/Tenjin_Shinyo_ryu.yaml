      Tenjin Shinyo-ryu (天神真楊流, Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū), meaning
      "Divine True Willow School", can be classified as a traditional
      school (koryū) of jujutsu. It was founded by Iso Mataemon
      Ryūkansai Minamoto no Masatari (磯又右衛門柳関斎源正足) in the
      1830s. Its syllabus comprises atemi-waza (striking
      techniques), nage-waza (throwing techniques), torae-waza
      (immobilization methods), and shime-waza (choking
      techniques). Once a very popular jujutsu system in Japan, among
      the famous students who studied the art were Kanō Jigorō, whose
      modern art of judo was greatly inspired by the Tenjin
      Shin'yō-ryū and Kitō-ryū.
