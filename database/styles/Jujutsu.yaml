      Jujutsu, also known as jiu-jitsu and ju-jitsu, is a family of
      Japanese martial arts and a system of close combat (unarmed or
      with a minor weapon) that can be used in a defensive or
      offensive manner to kill or subdue one or more weaponless or
      armed and armored opponents. It was designed in the 1530s and is
      coined by Hisamori Tenenuchi when he officially established the
      first school of Jiu-Jitsu in Japan. A subset of techniques from
      certain styles of jujutsu were used to develop many modern
      martial arts and combat sports, such as judo, aikido, sambo,
      ARB, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and mixed martial arts.
