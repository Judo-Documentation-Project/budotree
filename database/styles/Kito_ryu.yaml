      The Kitō Ryu [起倒流] is a system of jujutsu that merits a
      particular place in the doctrine of unarmed martial arts because
      of its esoteric elements, adopted along with various techniques
      and training methods (such as randori) in Judo. Of particular
      interest are the kata that have been preserved by the modern
      inheritors of kito ryu. Kito ryu is the "rise and fall" school
      of jujutsu.  Some of the available records trace the origin of
      this school to a Chinese combat based upon the principle of ju
      (suppleness), as explained and illustrated by Chin Gempin to
      selected warriors of 17th century Japan. Another version
      associates this method with two other noted jujutsu experts,
      Yoshimura and Takenaka.
