      Mikinosuke Kawaishi (川石 酒造之助, Kawaishi Mikinosuke, born 13
      August 1899 – 30 January 1969) was a Japanese master of jujutsu
      and judo who achieved the rank of 7th Dan. He led the
      development of Judo in France, with Shozo Awazu, and much of
      Europe and is credited with introducing the colored belt system
      for differentiating early grades. However, written accounts from
      the archives of London's Budokwai judo club, founded in 1918,
      record the use of colored judo belts at the 1926 9th annual
      Budokwai Display, and a list of ranked colored judokas appears
      in the Budokwai Committee Minutes of June 1927. Kawaishi visited
      London and the Budokwai in 1928, and was probably inspired to
      bring the colored belt system to France. The Fédération
      Française posthumously awarded him 10th Dan in judo and jujutsu.
