      Keiko Fukuda (Japanese: 福田 敬子, Hepburn: Fukuda Keiko, April
      12, 1913 – February 9, 2013) was a Japanese-American martial
      artist. She was the highest-ranked female judoka in history,
      holding the rank of 9th dan from the Kodokan (2006), and 10th
      dan from USA Judo (July 2011) and from the United States Judo
      Federation (USJF) (September 2011), and was the last surviving
      student of Kanō Jigorō, founder of judo.
      She was a renowned pioneer of women's judo, together with her
      senpai Masako Noritomi (1913–1982) being the first woman
      promoted to 6th dan (c. 1972). In 2006 the Kodokan promoted
      Fukuda to 9th dan.[8] She is also the first and, so far, only
      woman to have been promoted to 10th dan in the art of judo.

She began studying the art at Professor Kano's request at age 21 and since that time has taught in Australia,Canada, the Philippines, the U.S. and, of course, the Kodokan where she has received all her promotions (...) In the Kodokan, sometimes we would sit around the mat with Professor Kano and just talk and ask questions so we would know what each other was thinking"
