      Morihiro Saito (斉藤 守弘 Saitō Morihiro) was a teacher of the
      Japanese martial art of aikido, with many students around the
      world. Saito's practice of aikido spanned 56 years, from the age
      of 18, when he first met aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba, until
      his death in 2002.  The kind of aikido that Saito's students do
      is often referred to as Iwama aikido or Iwama style. In Europe,
      Saito, along with many of his students, formed a dan-ranking
      network of dojos called Iwama Ryu, with ranks received directly
      from Saito rather than or in addition to those from the Aikikai
      although Saito never left that organization.
