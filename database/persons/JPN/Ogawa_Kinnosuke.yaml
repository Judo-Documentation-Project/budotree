      Ogawa Kinnosuke was born in 1884 in Aiichi prefecture. He began
      kendo whilst in school, at around 13/15 years of age, under
      kendo hanshi Kato Kiichi and later under Kohori Yasutada. In his
      late teens and very early 20s he taught kendo at a middle school
      and joined the army (field gunnery position) before being
      employed by Nagoya police department. He was a student and later
      an instructor at the Budo Senmon Gakko, as well as in the Nagoya
      police. He was a Butokukai hanshi and was Busen's principle
      kendo instructor in the 1930's and up until 1945.

          citation: "In 1905 a school was formally opened to teach
            kendo instructors and Naito was selected as the senior
            teacher. At this time the school was known as the Bujutsu
            Kyoin Yoseijo, but eventually (after a few
            re-organisations and renames) it would be known to
            everyone as Busen (Budo Senmon Gakko). It was to this
            school that Ogawa was dispatched by the Nagoya police
            department in 1907. Ogawa would spend 3 years studying
            kendo directly under Naito."
