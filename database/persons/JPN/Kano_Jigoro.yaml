    Jigoro Kano (嘉納 治五郎, 10 December 1860 – 4 May
    1938[3]) was a Japanese educator, athlete, and the founder of
    Judo. Along with Ju-Jutsu, Judo was one of the first Japanese
    martial arts to gain widespread international recognition, and the
    first to become an official Olympic sport. Pedagogical innovations
    attributed to Kanō include the use of black and white belts, and
    the introduction of dan ranking to show the relative ranking among
    members of a martial art style. Well-known mottoes attributed to
    Kanō include "good use of energy" (精力善用 seiryoku zen'yō) and
    "mutual welfare and benefit" (自他共栄 jita kyōei).
