# Martial Arts Lineage Tree
### Judo Documentation Project

The Martial Arts Lineage Tree is a community-driven database of
teacher/student interactions, presented as an interactive lineage
tree.

There are three main components to this:

- A database of persons, training places, styles, organisations, and
  sources, using YAML as the format to make manual editing in a
  structured form as painless as possible.
- A parser that converts the database into a [Cytoscape.js JSON
  format](https://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/Supported_Network_File_Formats.html#cytoscape-js-json), supported in both [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org) and [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/)
- A web viewer that presents the data as an interactive tree,
  facilitating exploration of the (sometimes complex) lineage tree.
